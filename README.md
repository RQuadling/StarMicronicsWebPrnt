A GitHub copy of the Star Micronics Web Print code found at http://www.starmicronics.com/support/sdkdocumentation.aspx.

# Changes made by DigiTickets

1. We have added support for the CommonJS module format.
2. We have added a `main.json` file to act as a package entry point.
3. We have created `bower.json` and `package.json` files to help manage dependencies and deployment.

# Versioning

As of writing this README, the version of the package from Star Micronics is `1.6.0`. But as we had previously published
this package to the NPM registry, we cannot use `1.6.0+1`, so, `1.6.0` will be released as `1.6.1`, but future versions
will be released using Star's own version number with the `+1` metadata suffix.
